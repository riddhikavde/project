     <p>Itvedant provides placement support for its career-focused training courses, with a claimed highest salary package of ₹19.5 LPA, 40,000+ learners trained, and over 5,000 hiring companies. The institute's placement policy includes a minimum of 5 interview opportunities for all learners, with unlimited opportunities for those who achieve a final exam score of 75% or higher. While many alumni share positive experiences of securing jobs after completing the programs, some reviews suggest that placement timelines and salary packages may not meet all expectations. 
Placement support and policies
Interview opportunities: All learners receive a minimum of 5 interview opportunities after resume verification.
Unlimited interviews: Learners who score 75% or above on their final exam are eligible for unlimited interview opportunities.
Additional interviews: Those who don't meet the 75% threshold can get additional interviews after completing an interview improvement plan.
Placement drives: The institute reports conducting over 1,000 placement drives.
Placement guarantee: Itvedant advertises "100% Placement Support" but notes that they do not guarantee a specific salary, company, or role. 
Success stories and statistics
Highest salary: A claimed highest salary package is ₹19.5 LPA.
Learners trained: Over 40,000 learners have been trained.
Hiring companies: The institute claims to work with over 5,000 hiring companies.
Alumni experiences: Many alumni have reported successful placements in roles like Python Developer, Software Developer, and Data Analyst. One 2024 graduate reported being placed with a 14.4 LPA package after the program helped them gain the practical knowledge needed for interviews. 
Points to consider
Varying timelines and packages: While some students have had positive experiences, others have reported longer-than-expected job search durations and salaries below what was initially advertised, as seen in this Quora thread.
Policy details: It's important to review the specific placement policy details, including the "No Show Policy" for missing interviews, and the requirements for unlimited interview opportunities.
